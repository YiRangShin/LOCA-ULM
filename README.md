Context-Aware Deep Learning Enables High-Efficacy Localization of High Concentration Microbubbles for Super-Resolution Ultrasound Localization Microscopy, Nat Commun 15, 2932 (2024). https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-47154-2
We offer two notebooks to introduce LOCA-ULM: 

(1) Least Squares Generative Adversarial Networks (LSGAN) training to create synthetic microbubble signals
(2) Generating simulation data for online training
